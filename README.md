# vue-countries

## Overview

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it.

This is more about the architecture of your code and less about the function itself. We will assess you on the structure, the hierarchy of objects and the overall design.

# General Requirements

* User __has to__ list all countries from the API on the homepage.
* User __has to__ search for a country using an `input` field.
* User __can__ filter countries by region.
* User __has to__ click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page.
* User __can__ view and click through to the border countries on the detail page.
* You __can__ put comments where you describe why you do certain things or just explaining some more high level
 decision.
* You __can__ use a CSS Framework (Bootstrap, Bulma, Tailwind, etc.…).
* You __have to__ use a JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [Vue](https://vuejs.org) (recommended
) or [React](https://reactjs.org).
* You __can__ use packages, to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.
